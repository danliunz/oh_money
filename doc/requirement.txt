The document lists basic requirements for "OhMoney" project

=== Project Statement ===

stuff in New Zealand is not cheap ;), so I need a mobile-friendly web app to 
help track my daily expense and give decent reports

=== Requirement Breakdown ===

* User sign in and sign up (with remember-me mechanism)

  (optional) try not to use existing gem like 'devise'

* Allows users to enter detailed daily expense

  * individual expense item is associated with multiple hierachical tags
  
    No more than 3 levels of hierachy
    
      e.g.
      At 2016-01-01, "curry" => [:lunch, :at_curry_pot]
      At 2016-01-02, "curry" => [:dinner, :at_planet_spice]
      At 2016-01-03, "wine" => [:beverage, :at_countdown]
      At 2016-01-03, "ballpen" => [:stationery, :at_newworld]
      
      tag hierachy
      :lunch => [:food]
      :dinner => [:food]
      
  * A web UI to add/edit/delete tags and their hierachical relationship
  
      To speed up manual data entry, prompt based on existing data is available
      UI must be mobile device friendly
      
      Provide predefined tags(import data from trademe?)
      
  * A web UI to add/edit/delete expense items and link them to categories
      
      To speed up manual data entry, prompt based on existing data is available
      UI must be mobile device friendly
      
      Provide prefefined tags(import data from trademe?)
      
      (optinal) detect similar words (e.g. bike/bicycle)

* Generate reports giving users insight of their expense history

  * View list of expense items
    Can be filtered by tag(s)
    Can be filtered by date range
    Ordered by purchase date
  
  * Aggregate report of expense history
    Can be narrowed down by date range
    Can be narrowed down by tag(s): support intersection and union of tags
  
  * View expense trend
    Can be narrowed down by date range and tag(s)
    Break down expense amount into daily/weekly/monthly bracket, show interactive chart

  * All report criteria can be saved into user profile for ease reaccess
  
  * Expense watcher
  
    User customizes criteria for expense alert, e.g.
    "if total expense last week exceeds average weekly expense by over"
    "30%, generates an alert and drops me an email"
    
    "Set my daily budget to $50, if average expense last week exceeds it,"
    "generates an alert and drops me an email"
    
    User can view prior alerts
